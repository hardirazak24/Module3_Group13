# RKE (Remote Keyless Entry)

## Introduction

* Remote keyless entry is a system or a divice which was first indroduced in the year 1980, by Ford automobile manufacturing company. Main aim of this system is to lock/unlock the
  car wirelessly and ensure security of the car. This system mainly works on two components transmitter and reciever for transmission of the radio signals. Keyless remotes contain
  a short range radio transmitter which usually transmits the signals for a range of 5–20 meters, of the car to work. When a button is pushed, it sends a coded signal by radio
  waves to a receiver unit in the car, which locks or unlocks the door. Most RKEs operate at a frequency of 315 MHz to a frequency of 433.92 MHz.
